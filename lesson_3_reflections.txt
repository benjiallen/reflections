## When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

* Backup!
* When you want to collaborate with others.
* When you want to show the world your work.

## Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

* Someone may have updated the repo on Github. If you automatically update the local repo that you're working on then you might get changes that you weren't ready for. In other words, your code could break because your program has a change in it that you were not expecting. Keeping track of work would be difficult. You would have a mix of changes that you're making and changes that other contributors are making.
* Merge conflicts. You might pull down merge conflicts that you want to handle manually.

## Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

* Forks
    - Fork someone else's repo when you don't have permission to change the repo. By forking on github.com you have a copy of the repo on github.com associated to your account and referencing the original repo.
* Clones
    - Clone a repo when you want a copy of a git repo. For example, cloning from github.com. You can also clone locally. You might want to clone instead of branch because you know you're going to take the work in a completely different direction.
* Branches
    - Branch your work when you have a new idea that you want to work on. While you're working on the new idea you don't break the master branch.

## What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

* You can work out how far in front or behind you are with the remote
    - This might prompt you to push to remote

Tough question. Will need to give this more thought.

## How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

This goes back to options discussed earlier in the course. Options could include:

* Email + attachments
    - Easier: 
        + ???
    - Harder:
        + Keeping track of your changes and different versions of your project
        + Collaborating with others
        + Adding comments to changes
        + Dealing with merge conflicts
        + Branching
* Google Drive
    - Easier:
        + If you're just editing Word-type documents then adding comments to the document would be easier
        + Collaborating is also super easy
    - Harder:
        + Merge conflicts and overwriting each other's changes
        + Keeping track of who changes what
        + Branching
* Dropbox
    - Similar to email. Dropbox does support version history but it's not much better than email.
* An alternative version control system that is not git or github
    - May or may not have feature parity with git or github

## When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

* When to make changes on a branch rather than master
    - I would use it when I'm working on something experimental and do not want to "break" the stable project present in the master branch
    - It would also make sense to use branching when you're collaborating with others. It would keep my changes in a "neat" unit of work which my collarborators could evaluate before merging to the master branch.
* When to change master directly
    - When there is not any collaboration
    - When you know your master branch is in an unstable state anyway. Perhaps you've just started a project and you're still forming a functioning product.
